SPECIAL THANKS TO: drconfused1- For the suggestion of changing from damage based to a chance based dismemberment system. Thus basically creating the main features of this mod, dismemberment. You Rock!


FUN FACT: You can now dismember all limbs on a zombie and keep it alive with only its head and torso! It will still bite you if you get near its head!
